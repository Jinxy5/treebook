<h1> Viewing Friendship </h1>

<!--
	If we're the requested user do this.
	So basically this means, if @user_friendship.requested? = true

	and @user_friendship is the current user, scoped to the current user.

	this is something to do with the 

	state: :requested 

	method in the state machine. That dynamically creates the 'requested' method. Not sure how it all fits together though

	what does it prove?

	I think it's simply something to do with the |state| attribute of the User_friendship. If the current user_friendship has a .state of
	requested, do this.

	I think this:

	state_maachine :state, initial: :pending do
		state: :accepted
	end

	if @user_friendship.requested?
		puts "The state is accepted!"
	end

	is a shorthand for this:

	if @user_friendship.state == "accepted"
		puts "The state is accepted!"
	end

	but I still fail to see the reasoning:

	Transcript:

	So what we're doing is we're saying if this user_friendship object is a requested friendship
11:29
this means that the current user is the one who is being requested
11:32
when we create this user_friendship form, it goes to the accept_user_friendship path,
11:40
and the method is put since we're updating the resource.
11:45
And we just have a submit_tag for accepting the friendship.
